This was one of my early React practice projects that wasn't just a step by step tutorial  on YouTube. I had a couple ideas of what kind of _thing_ to build, and knew I wanted to call an external API to display something on the screen.

But this was more about process than product. I was less concerned about the end result, and more about how I got there.

That said, the designer part of my brain wasn't going to let me forget form ~~can be~~ ~~should be~~ **_is_** a part of function. But considering this was more about the code than the designs, I was fine with something over engineered to look pretty cool. Plus that'd give me more opportunity for trial and error. (**Spoiler**: it was mostly error)

So I played around with adding packages like [React Starfield Animation](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-starfield-animation) and [Vanta](https://github.com/tengbao/vanta), which contained a number of custom React components I could import, as well as options to reference external script files.

This is where my inexperience really started to make things a lot harder. Most of the time I was getting a lot of errors and things weren't loading at all, or when they were loading I would bump into some other issue. I knew I was overcomplicating things a bit, so I eventually decided to look at other options.

> [React Starfield Animation](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-starfield-animation) and [Vanta](https://github.com/tengbao/vanta) are really great, well built repos. My inexperience shouldn't discourage you from checking them out.

Then I came across the [Evil Insult Generator](https://github.com/EvilInsultGenerator) repo and I decided to model my project on that kind of project. I did have some trouble with the API calls so I decided to clone all of the insult data locally. And that made it a bit easier to filter out some of the insults that I preferred not having in my repo. I drew a bit of visual inspiration from the Evil Insult website, but added my own flare, of course.

I also used [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) to achieve some nice other animation effects, but I knew I was only scratching the surface here. Learning a lesson from the last challenges I decided to keep things simple and came up with something I'm quite happy with.

I had a bunch of fun on this, along with plenty of opportunities to practice these insults on my screen. Thanks for taking the time to read!
